## Requirements
Main packages:
- python=3.6.7
- pytorch=1.8.1
- torchvision=0.9.1
- cudatoolkit=10.2.89

Or directly create a conda env with
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

## Data preparation
1. Clone this repo:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/haibo-qiu/SynFace.git
    ```
2. Clone the [DiscoFaceGAN](https://github.com/microsoft/DiscoFaceGAN) and insert our files as the mixup face generator (To run [DiscoFaceGAN](https://github.com/microsoft/DiscoFaceGAN), you also need to satisfy its requirements.):
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/microsoft/DiscoFaceGAN.git data/DiscoFaceGAN
    cp data/syn_factors.py data/DiscoFaceGAN/
    cp data/syn_images.py data/DiscoFaceGAN/
    ```

3. Generate the face images with identity mixup, following with face alignment and crop:
    ```
    bash data/syn.sh
    ```
4. Download the real face data CASIA and LFW from [this link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1XTkS2Rh7Q154rwcV0MfhZ69cG10bEFDt?usp=sharing)
5. Put all these data into ```data/datasets/```

## Training
Simply run the following script:
```
bash run.sh
```

## Testing
To reproduce the results in our paper, please download the [pretrained models](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1XTkS2Rh7Q154rwcV0MfhZ69cG10bEFDt?usp=sharing) and put them in ```pretrained/```, then run:
```
bash eval.sh
```

## Acknowledgement
The code of face alignment and crop ```data/imgs_crop/``` is borrowed from [face.evoLVe](https://github.com/ZhaoJ9014/face.evoLVe#Data-Zoo) and re-written with multi-processing for acceleration.
